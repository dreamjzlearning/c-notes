## 1.  Pointers and Addresses

```c
// the & operator assigns the address of c
// to the variable p.
p = &c;
```

The unary operator `&` gives the address of an object. The `&` operator only applies to objects in memory: variables and array elements. It cannot be applied to expressions, constants, or register variables.

```c
int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
int *ip; // ip is a pointer to int

ip = &x; // ip points to x
y = *ip; // y is 1
*ip = 0; // change the value of x, x is 0 
ip = &z[0]; // ip points to z[0]
```

The unary operator `*` is the indirection or dereferencing operator; when applied to a pointer, it accesses the object the points to.

`int *ip` is intended as a mnemonic, it says that the expression `*ip` is an int.

## 2. Pointers and Function Arguments

Pointer arguments enable a function to access and change objects in the function that called it.

```c
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp;
    
    temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
```

## 3. Pointers and Arrays

Any operation that can be achieved by array subscripting can also be done with pointers. The pointer version will generally be **faster** but, somewhat harder to understand.

`int a[10]` defines an array `a` of size `10`, a block of 10 consecutive objects named `a[0], a[1], ..., a[9]`.

If `pa` points to the element `a[i]`, then `pa+1` points to the next element, `pa+i` points to `i` elements after `pa`, and `pq-i` points to `i` elements before. Thus, if `pa` points to `a[i]`, `*(pa+1)` refers to the contents of a[i+1].

In evaluating `a[i]`, C converts it to `*(a+i)` immediately, the two forms are equivalent. If `pa` is a pointer, expressions can use it with a subscript; `pa[i]` is identical to `*(pa+i)`. In short, an array-and-index expression is equivalent to one written as a pointer and offset.

One difference between an array name and a pointer is that a pointer is a variable, so `pa++, pa=a` are legal, but an array name is not a variable, `a=pa, a++` are illegal.

When an array name is passed to a function, what is passed is the location of the initial element. `void f(char s[])` and `void f(char *s)` are equivalent.

It is possible to pass **part of an array** to a function by passing a pointer to the beginning of the subarray.

```c
void f1(int arr[]);
void f2(int *arr);

// pass subarray
f1(&a[2]);
f2(a+2);
```

If one is sure that the elements exist, it is also possible to index backward in an array, 

`p[-1], p[-2]` are legal.

## 4. Address Arithmetic

Pointers can be compared under certain circumstances.

If `p` and `q` point to members of the same array:

- relations like `==, !=, <, >, ...` work properly.
- `p+n, p-n` are valid.
- `p-q`: the number of elements from p to q inclusive.

```c
/*
    A rudimentary storage allocator.
*/

#define ALLOC_SIZE 10000 // size of available space

static char allocbuf[ALLOC_SIZE]; // storage for alloc
static char* allocp = allocbuf; // next free position

// alloc returns pointer to characters
char* alloc(int n) {
    if (allocbuf + ALLOC_SIZE - allocp >= n) { // it fits
        allocp += n;
        return allocp - n; // old p
    }

    // not enough room
    return 0;
}

// afree frees storage pointed to by p
void afree(char* p) {
    if (p >= allocbuf && p < allocbuf + ALLOC_SIZE) {
        allocp = p;
    }
}
```

## 5. Character Pointers and Functions

```c
char message[] = "now is the time"; // array
char *pmessage = "now is the time"; // pointer
```

`message` is an array that big enough to hold the sequence of characters and ‘\0’. `pmessage` is a pointer, initialized to point to a string constant.

```c
// copy string
// array subscript version
void strcpy(char *s, char *t) {
    int i;
    
    i = 0;
    while ((s[i] = t[i]) != '\0') {
        i++;
    }
}

// pointer version
void strcpy(char *s, char *t) {
    while ((*s = *t) != '\0') {
        s++;
        t++;
    }
}

void strcpy(char *s, char *t) {
    while ((*s++ = *t++) != '\0');
}

void strcpy(char *s, char *t) {
    while (*s++ = *t++); // the value of '\0' is 0
}
```

## 6. Multi-dimensional Arrays

A two-dimensional array is a one-dimensional array, each of whose element is an array.

```c
int arr[row][col]; 
```

If a 2d array is passed to a function, the parameter declaration must include the number of **columns**.

```c
f(int arr[][10]);
f(int (*arr)[10]);
```

## 7. Pointers vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays

```c
int a[10][20];
int *b[10];
```

- `a`: 200 int-sized locations have been set aside.
- `b`: only allocate 10 pointers but not initialize them. 
  The advantage of a pointer array is that the rows of an array can be of different lengths.

## 8. Command-line arguments

```c
void main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    //...
}
```

- `argc`: the number of command-line arguments
- `argv`: command-line arguments, `argv[0]` is the program name.

## 9. Pointers to Functions

```c
void qsort(void *v[], int left, int right, int (*comp)(void *, void *)) {
    //...
    for (i = left+1; i <= right; i++) {
        if ((*comp)(v[i], v[left]) < 0) {
            //...
        }
    }
    //...
}

int numcmp(char *s1, char *s2) {
    //...
}
```

- `void *`: any pointer can be cast to `void *` and back again without loss of information.
- `int (*comp)(void *, void *)` 
  `comp` is a pointer to a function that has two `void *` arguments and returns an `int`.
- `int *comp(void *, void *)` means `comp` is a function and returns an `int` pointer.
- `if ((*comp)(v[i], v[left]) < 0)`
  `comp` is a pointer to a function, `*comp` is a function.
