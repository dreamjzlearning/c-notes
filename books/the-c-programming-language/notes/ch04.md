## 1. Basics

A function definition has the form:

```c
return-type function-name (argument declarations) {
    ...
    return expr;
}
```

## 2. External variables

- ***definition***: 
  Announces the properties of a variable and causes storage to be set aside.

  ```c
  int sp;
  double val[10];
  ```

  The statements above **define** `sp` and `val`, causing **storage** to be set aside.

- ***declaration***:
  It just announces the properties of a variable.

  ```c
  extern int sp;
  extern double val[];
  ```

  Define the `sp` and `val`, but do not create the variables or reserve storage for them.

There must be **only one definition** of an external variable among all the files that make up the source program. Other files may contain **extern declarations** to access it.

```c
in file1:
	// declaration
	extern int sp;
	extern double val[];
	
	void f1() {}
	double f2() {}

in file2:
	// definition
	int sp = 0;
	double val[10];
```

## 3. Header Files

A header file is a file that contains **declarations** of functions, variables, constants, macros, and types that can be shared between multiple source files. Header files typically have a `.h` extension and are included in source files using the `#include` directive. 

## 4. Static 

### 4.1 Static Local Variables

When a local variable is declared as `static`, it retains its value between function calls.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void count() {
    static int counter = 0;  // Retains value across function calls
    counter++;
    printf("Counter: %d\n", counter);
}

int main() {
    count();  // Output: 1
    count();  // Output: 2
    count();  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### 4.2 Static Global Variables

When a global variable is declared as `static`, its visibility is restricted to the file which it is declared.

```c
// file1.c
#include <stdio.h>

static int globalVar = 42;  // File-scoped, can't be accessed outside this file

void printVar() {
    printf("Global variable: %d\n", globalVar);
}

// file2.c
#include <stdio.h>

extern void printVar();

int main() {
    printVar();  // Works, but cannot access globalVar directly
    return 0;
}

```

### 4.3 Static Functions

When a function is declared as `static`, its visibility is restricted to the file in which it is declared.

```c
// file1.c
#include <stdio.h>

static void myFunction() {
    printf("This is a static function.\n");
}

void callMyFunction() {
    myFunction();  // Can be called within the file
}

// file2.c
extern void callMyFunction();

int main() {
    callMyFunction();  // Works, but can't directly call myFunction()
    return 0;
}

```

- **Static Local Variables**: Retain their value across multiple function calls. They are initialized only once.

- **Static Global Variables**: Are visible only within the file they are defined in (file-scoped).

- **Static Functions**: Are visible and callable only within the file where they are defined (file-scoped).

## 4. Register Variables

```c
register int x;
register char c;

// The register declaration can only be applied to automatic variables
// and to the formal parameters of a fucntion
void f(register int p1, register int p2) {
    register int i;
    ...
}
```

A register declaration advises the compiler that the variable will be heavily used. Register variables are to be placed in machine registers, which may result in smaller and faster programs. But compilers are free to ignore the advice.

## 5. Preprocessor

The preprocessor is a separate first step in compilation. 

The two most frequently used features are `#include` and `#define`.

### 5.1 File Inclusion

File inclusion makes it easy to handle collections of `#defines` and declarations. Any source line of the form `#include <filename>` or `#include "filename"` is replaced by the contents of the file `filename`.

`include`

- `“filename”`: searching for the file where the source program was found. If not found there, searching follows an implementation-defined rule.
- `<filename>`: searching follows an implementation-defined rule.

When an included file is changed, all files that depend on it must be recompiled.

### 5.2 Macro Substitution

```
#define name replacement_text
```

The token `name` will be replaced by the `replacement_text`. 

A long definition can be continued onto several lines by placing a `\` at the end of each line.

- Any name can be defined with any replacement:
  ```c
  #define forever for (;;) // infinite loop
  ```

- Define with arguments:
  ```c
  #define max(A, B) ((A) > (B) ? (A) : (B))
  ```

  Each occurrence of a formal parameter will be replaced by the corresponding actual argument.
  ```c
  x = max(p+q, r+s);
  // will be placed by
  x = ((p+q) > (r+s) ? (p+q) : (r+s));
  ```

- Names can be undefined with `#undef` to ensure that a routine is really a function:
  ```c
  #undef getchar
  int getchar();
  ```

- If a parameter name is preceded by a `#` in the replacement text, the combination will be **expanded** into a **quoted string** with the parameter replaced by the actual argument.
  ```c
  #define dprintf(expr) printf(#expr "=%g\n", expr)
  
  dprint(x/y);
  
  // expand into
  printf("x/y = %g\n", x/y);
  ```

- If a parameter in the replacement text is adjacent to a `##`, the parameter is replaced by the actual argument, the `##` and surrounding white space are removed.
  ```c
  #define paste(front, back) front ## back
  
  paste(name, 1)
  // expand into
  name1    
  ```

### 5.3 Conditional Inclusion

The `#if` evaluates a constant integer expression.

- if the expression is **non-zero**, subsequent lines until and `#endif` or `elif` or `#eles` are included.
- The expression `defined(name)` int a `#if` is 1 if the `name` has been defined, and 0 otherwise.

```c
#if !defined(HDR)
#define HDR
//...
#endif

// e.g.
#if SYSTEM == SYSV
	#define HDR "sysv.h"
#elif SYSTEM == BSD
	#define HDR "bsd.h"
#elif SYSTEM == MSDOS
	#define HDR "msdos.h"
#endif
#include HDR
```

The `#ifdef` and `ifndef` lines are specialized forms that test whether a name is defined.

```c
#ifndef HDR
#define HDR
//...
#endif
```
